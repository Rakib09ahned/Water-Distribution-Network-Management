# Water-Distribution-Network-Management
This C++ program uses the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate the maximum flow in a water distribution network. The network is represented as a graph, where nodes are locations (e.g., water sources or destinations), and edges represent pipes with specific capacities.
